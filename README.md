# Connect Four AI - Python

Ever heard of the famous Garry Kasparov vs Deep Blue match - the first time a supercomputer outmatched the world chess champion? Ever thought about designing complex game engines to beat your friends at all their favorite strategy board games? Ever dreamed of constructing an unstoppable AI that you could harness to *take over the whole fucking WORLD*? Well, let your dreams be mere dreams and step with me into the mediocre newbie world of poorly optimized code. A world where you're the worst coder by far in your league, but you honestly don't care because your prototype tic-tac-toe game can still manage to beat a handful of distracted humans a whole three games out of ten. Then, rise from this subpar victory, and join me in a Python-fest of mediocrity, where the source code is short and the processing time long, and people still say "Omigosh! You're so smart." Then climb with me to a rung barely superior to that mediocrity and write your own classically programmed Connect Four AI.

It'll beat you, smash you, crush you at every turn. It's unstoppable, fearless, remarkable, relentless. It can't talk to you or intimidate you like normal 6-year-old players would, but oh can it play! The most remarkable thing is, it actually gets *less* powerful the more moves ahead you tell it to look (beyond about three or so). It's remarkable! Like a 13-year-old edgelord who wants you to think he's good so he spends all day staring at the chessboard with a glazed look in his eyes, but after hours of non-analysis he makes a worse move than what he would've made if he just looked at the board for one minute and went.  That's what my Connect Four AI does. It plays a solid game up until 3-moves-ahead visibility, but crashes down into weakness if told to even try analyzing any farther.
